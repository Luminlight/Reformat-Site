# Reformat-Site
I never fail to forget multiple things before and after reformatting, this site is meant to help alleviate that.

The initial plan is to have a list of things I should do prior to reformatting and also a list after.

Additions will come in the form of: 
    Expanding to a larger audience (not solely focused on me).
    Expanding to a general audience with less knowledge, beginning to explain the why and how of reformatting.
